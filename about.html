          <h3><b>Education and Experience</b></h3> 
          <p>After getting my high school certificate,
            I did computer packages and that is when my programming journey began.
            I fell in love with technology and decided to explore it by taking online coding classes.
            Later on,I heard about Moringa school from a friend and how much it has brought a difference into the lives of many
         young developers today.
            I researched about it and signed up for a full course.
            I am now a student at Moringa school.The experience is challanging but mind blowing at the same time.
            It is certainly the best place a programmer would want to be.</p>

                  <p>I'm expecting to finish my course in Moringa and graduate as a full stack web developer.
                     I also want to take a Data Science course later on as i'm working.
                     My goal is to become an expert in web development and help other people who are willing to learn programming
                     get a chance to do it too.

                          that there are many ways to get to what you really want.There will always be barriers to hinder you
                          from reaching your goals but you can do it just with the right attitude and mindset.
                          Take every opportunity that comes your way,you might just discover your purpose in life that way.
